        From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for thousands of years.
        Ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars.
        They called these objects "planets," meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman
        deitiesâ€”Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;
        Venus, the goddes of love and beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of
        agriculture. The stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and
        meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky. Since the invention of
        the telescope, three more planets have been discovered in our solar system:
        Uranus (1781), Neptune (1846), and, now downgraded to a dwarf planet, Pluto (1930).
        In addition, there are thousands of asteroids and comets. Most of
        the asteroids orbit in a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, while the
        home of comets lies far beyond the orbit of Pluto, in the Oort Cloud.</p>
